./node_modules/.bin/generate-icon ./App/Images/customFont/style.css --componentName=icomoon --fontFamily=icomoon > ./node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/icomoon.js && cp ./App/Images/customFont/icomoon.ttf ./node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/icomoon.ttf

!Trouble Shooting: Red screen with "Unrecognized font family" error on iOS
Make sure you've added the fonts to your XCode project.
Check that the font you are trying to use appears in Info.plist, if you've added the whole folder and it's blue in color, then you need to add it to the path.
Check that the font is copied in the Copy Bundle Resources in Build Phases.
Recompile the project.
